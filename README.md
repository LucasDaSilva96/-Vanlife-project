# VanLife APP

## This is my version of the Vanlife project from Scrimba, and the goal of this project is to practice react-router.

### Auth-logic

This app uses a fake auth-logic, and if you want to "login" use the following information:

- EMAIL: example@test.com
- PASSWORD: test123

### Backend

I'm using firebase for the backend
